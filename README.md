# pig-game

Pig game is a two player game where the first player to reach 100 will become the winner. Each turn, the player can roll a dice or hold. Each dice roll will add to the accumulated score for that player's round. If the player choose to hold, the accumulated score for that round will be added to the player's total score. If the user rolls and the result is 1, the accumulated score for that round will be back to 0 and the round ends. Thus, the player's accumulated score for that round will be discarded and will start the other player's turn.
